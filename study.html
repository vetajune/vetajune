    <h4>WEBSITES</h4>
    <img src="khan.png" alt="khan academy logo" width="300" height="100">
    <p>Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers an extensive library of video lessons spanning subjects from mathematics to humanities. It serves as a valuable resource for supplementing your coursework or gaining fresh insights into challenging topics. I personally recommend this if you need extra help in math classes, there’s a lot of practice questions and videos if you need more explanations. Additionally, because of the large community they have, if you have a question there are many users to help you!
        -	Vetas Experience: I used this countless times when I was lost in math classes, the more practice the better!</p>
    <img src="coursera.png" alt="coursera logo" width="200" height="200">
    <p>Coursera: Exploring courses beyond what courses is an easy with Coursera, offering access to online courses from many universities and institutions worldwide. You can earn certificates in many areas. They offer some free courses for students, offering you a chance to explore specific skills in your own time!
        -	Vetas Experience: I used this to get certificates in UX design, this is a great resume builder!</p>
    <img src="library.jpg" alt="library" width="200" height="100">
    <p>UofSC University Library Resources: Our university library is more than just a collection of books; it's a great resource for research! You have access to many paid websites, databases of articles, and even movies! 
        -	Vetas Experience: I used this to read articles on the NYTimes for free!</p>
    <h4>APPS</h4>
    <img src="quizlet.png" alt="quizlet logo" width="100" height="100">
    <p>Quizlet is an awesome flashcard app that offers many ways to study flashcard-based learning. You can create flashcards for your classes and practice them on the go, with options to set reminders to come back and study! This is a very user friendly app.
        -	Vetas Experience: I used this for almost every class I’ve taken. You can never go wrong with quizlet for any subject, I’m currently using it for accounting! I love the test feature it has where you can “take a test” using the flashcards you put in.</p>

    <img src="anki.jpg" alt="anki logo" width="200" height="100">
    <p>Anki: another excellent flashcard app, focuses on spaced repetition. It offers high levels of customization, allowing you to tailor your study experience precisely. This app is used by many medical students, and it offers more customization than quizlet does. This is a great app if you want to focus on long term memorization, although it has a less user friendly interface.
        -	Vetas Experience: I used this when I was studying the SAT! I would recommend this app for long term memory studying.
